The event loop is a system that lets JavaScript run asynchronous code by checking when the main thread is free and then executing queued tasks.
JavaScript runs normal (sync) code first

Async tasks (timers, promises, I/O) are queued

The event loop:

waits for the call stack to be empty

runs promise callbacks first

then runs timer/other callbacks

Repeats forever 🔁
